# Pokedex App

A simple "Pokedex" app turned into a game made with React.

## See it live

[Click here](https://codesandbox.io/s/pokegame-app-tcg0z?file=/src/App.js) to see my app running on CodeSandbox!

## Purpose

To practice using React components and properties.

Based on Colt Steele's Pokedex Project from _The Modern React Bootcamp_, I decided to tackle the the problem my own way and add my own touches.

## Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript
- Animate.css
- CSS 3
- HTML 5
- Git

## Features to Add in the Future

If I ever comeback to this project, here are a few things I think that could be improved upon:

- Add a backside to all cards
- Stager the animation so that each card is "dealt" one-by-one
- Make the game element more interactive
